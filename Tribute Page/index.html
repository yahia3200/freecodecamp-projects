              Rafael won an overwhelming victory over all his rivals and was
              noted by the President of the National Karate Federation, Yashar
              Bashirov, who saw great potential in him and his unusual fighting
              tactics. Aghayev was very diligent and had the will to win, but he
              lacked international experience. He first took part in the
              National Team in 1997, at the open World Cup in Miskolc, Hungary.
              His first performances were not successful at the international
              level competition, but the next year he won the Open Championship
              of England and performed very well from then on.

                At his first World Championship among Cadets and Juniors, which
                was held in 2001 in Athens, he won 3rd place in the team event,
                and the following year became the European Champion. Thus, up to
                this day, he holds the lead in his weight class. Despite his
                young age, he managed to achieve all of the highest sporting
                victories in karate; he is a multiple European Champion and
                repeated as World Champion. At one World Championship he was
                able to win two gold medals. This happened in 2008 at the 18th
                World Championship in Tokyo, when he won in the 70 kg weight
                category and in the open category. The President of the World
                Karate Federation, Antonio Espinosa called him the "Diamond of
                the Karate World."

                Hidayat Shabanov, a senior team coach, played an important role
                in Aghayev's career. For more than eight years, Shabanov trained
                him and shared in his victories. For outstanding sports
                achievements at the international arena, Aghayev has repeatedly
                received awards from the National Olympic Committee, the
                Ministry of Youth and Sport of Azerbaijan Republic, and he
                ranked amongst the ten best sportsmen of the country for several
                consecutive years. From the official sponsor of the Federation,
                the International Bank of Azerbaijan, he received the keys for a
                new apartment in one of the elite areas of the city, as well as
                an Audi Q7.
